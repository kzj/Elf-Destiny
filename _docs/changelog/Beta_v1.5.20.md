# Beta_v1.5.20
Added Unconventional and Exotic Beauty!

Nefertitis Armband added to Expedition loot table

Aeluran Characters will now wear red most of the time! 
Aeluran Matriarch is now the Aeluran head of faith
Aeluran faith has been modified to have lay clergy and temporal head of faith

Julia Melwood will now first spawn when you take the "What is an Archeologist?" decision and is not a historical character. This will ensure players always get a living fresh copy and are not rushed to take the decision immediately.
Feyswood is now a Kingdom

Bug Fix: Brewery buildings from new DLC now available
Bug Fix: Selecting Race now works for Landless Adventurers. Important Note: All player adventurers will get the last race selected by any player, so take note of that in Multiplayer. Something I want to keep working on.
Other minor things
